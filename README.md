## Project Intro/Objective
PyBank: The purpose of this project is to use Python script to analyze a company's financial records. The script analyzes the records to calculate the total nubmer of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period, the changes in profit/losses over the entire period, the average of those changes, the greatest increase in profits, and the greatest decrease in profits. The final script then exports the printed analysis to a text file.

PyPoll: In this challenge, Python script is used to analyze election data and calculate the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total nubmer of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. The final script then exports the printed analysis to a text file.
